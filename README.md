<h1 align="center">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures 
</h1>
</p>

I'm currently working on "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course from Code Camp.
Since my goal is to master JavaScript and structures that helps to build logic, I chose to take this course in the hope it would provide more structure and better
guidance than I was getting while "self-learning".
While taking part in this course, I have been taking notes and what-not and attempting all of the course projects to the
best of my abilities.
I'll be using this repo as a way for myself to access them as, if and when I need them.
All the personal projects for Great professor and great course, really recommend it:
